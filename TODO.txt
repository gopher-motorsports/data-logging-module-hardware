DEV BOARD TESTING
 - Test connecting to STM32 without a network switch
   - Switching TX and RX lines is not needed, there is hardware to do this
   - Set static IP and try to find it with laptop
 - Find and test pins for UART for telemetry (uart7 on PE7 and PE8)
   - Make sure basic TX works from the STM
 - Test CAN3 Pins
   - 3 GCAN Busses
 - Test new CAN trancievers
   - Get them on the test board and run them at 3.3V

SCHEMATIC CREATION

LAYOUT
 [_] Ask Jerimiah about x1 caps on phy
 [x] R33 and R34 are too close
 [x] R5 R4 R3 flip silckscreen
 [x] Add some silkscreen to some test points
 [x] Check silkscreen via positioning
 [x] Fix RMII and eth traces
 [x] Change silkscreen on 0602 components

 [_] Replace can tranciever to one in stock


REV2 LAYOUT
 - Rotate MCU to put the SD pins at the top of the board, not the right
   - This will also put RMII on the back which is good
 - Rotate Ethernet PHY 90degrees to put the magnetics in the correct spot realitive to the phy
   - RMII will also be to the right
 - Route traces through ESD protection first
   - Maybe use 2 or 3 ESD protection chips
 - Be smarter about test points and where to put them
