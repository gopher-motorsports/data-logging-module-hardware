 - Fix many schematic warnings
 - Test connecting to STM32 without a network switch (switch RX and TX lines and set IP manually)
 - Learn more about the whole ethernet block and figure out what is needed - maybe find new PHY that isnt so tiny
 - Find and test pins for UART for telemetry (uart7 on PE7 and PE8)
 - Test new CAN trancievers
 - Pick connector and finish connector schematic
 - Put some EMI filtering on the STLINK pins
