 - Fix many schematic errors
 - Test connecting to STM32 without a network switch (switch RX and TX lines and set IP manually)
 - Learn more about the whole ethernet block and figure out what is needed - maybe find new PHY that isnt so tiny
 - Find and test pins for UART for telemetry
 - Test new CAN trancievers
 - Finish MCU schematic
 - Pick connector and finish connector schematic
 - Do we really want ST-link connectors in the harness? (emi reasons)
