DEV BOARD TESTING
 - Test connecting to STM32 without a network switch
   - Switching TX and RX lines is not needed, there is hardware to do this
   - Set static IP and try to find it with laptop
 - Find and test pins for UART for telemetry (uart7 on PE7 and PE8)
   - Make sure basic TX works from the STM
 - Test new CAN trancievers
   - Get them on the test board and run them at 3.3V

SCHEMATIC CREATION
 - Pick connector and finish connector schematic
 - Put some EMI filtering on the STLINK pins?
 - Check power requirements
   - Current to ethernet PHY LEDs (check LED configurations)
   - Power to all chips
   - Current to LEDs the are pull on the STM
 - Find ferrite bead from dev board for the ethernet PHY

LAYOUT
 - Put testpoints around the ethernet PHY to allow for modifications if needed
 - Add RMII testpoints to use with another ethernet PHY board if needed
 - Put ESD chip close to the ethernet PHY and SD card pins
